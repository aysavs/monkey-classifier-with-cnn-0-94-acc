# Monkey Classifier with CNN

## Description

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify different species of monkeys. The model has been trained on a [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slothkong/10-monkey-species) and can accurately identify various monkey species with a high accuracy of 94%.

## Features

- **High Accuracy:** The model achieves an accuracy of 94%.
- **Dataset:** Utilizes a labeled dataset of monkey species.
- **CNN Model:** Developed using deep learning techniques and CNN architectures.
- **Python and Keras:** Built with Python and Keras libraries.

## Installation and Running

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or Keras)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

3. Clone or download the project to your desired directory.

### Running the Model

1. To train the model, execute the relevant Python script, for example, `train_model.py`:

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

2. To make predictions with the trained model, use `predict.py`:

    ```bash
    python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset can be obtained from sources like the [Kaggle Monkey Species Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slothkong/10-monkey-species ) or similar. Details on how to download and use the dataset should be provided within the project.

## Model Architecture

The model includes:

- **Convolutional Layers:** For feature extraction.
- **Pooling Layers:** To summarize features.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** For final classification decisions.

## Results

The trained model achieves a 94% accuracy rate. It can effectively identify different monkey species with high precision.
